  "baseExtractionPrompt": "\nPlease analyze the following meeting transcript and extract action items that require JIRA tickets. \n\nBE SELECTIVE - Only extract items that are:\n1. Explicit action items mentioned in the transcript\n2. Have clear deliverables or outcomes\n3. Require actual work to be completed\n4. Are NOT just discussion points, ideas, or casual mentions\n\nFor each GENUINE action item, provide:\n1. Title (brief, actionable - start with action verb like 'Create', 'Fix', 'Update', 'Investigate')\n2. Description (detailed explanation of what needs to be done)\n3. Assigned person (if mentioned)\n4. Due date (if mentioned)\n5. Priority (High/Medium/Low)\n6. Type (Task/Bug/Story/Investigation/Documentation/Review)\n7. Context (original text from transcript where this action was mentioned)\n8. RequiresJiraTicket - Set to TRUE only for concrete actionable items that need tracking\n\nMeeting: {title}\nDate: {date}\nParticipants: {participants}\n\nTranscript:\n{content}\n\nPlease respond in this JSON format:\n{{\n  \"actionItems\": [\n    {{\n      \"title\": \"Actionable title starting with verb (e.g. 'Fix authentication bug', 'Create user guide')\",\n      \"description\": \"Detailed description of what needs to be accomplished\",\n      \"assignedTo\": \"Person name or null\",\n      \"dueDate\": \"YYYY-MM-DD or null\",\n      \"priority\": \"High/Medium/Low\",\n      \"type\": \"Task/Bug/Story/Investigation/Documentation/Review\",\n      \"context\": \"Original conversation snippet from transcript\",\n      \"requiresJiraTicket\": true\n    }}\n  ]\n}}\n\nCRITICAL RULES:\n- QUALITY OVER QUANTITY: Extract fewer, well-defined action items rather than many vague ones\n- If someone says 'I'll create a ticket for X', that's ONE action item for X, not separate tickets\n- Don't extract sub-tasks unless they're explicitly mentioned as separate deliverables\n- Don't extract discussion topics or casual mentions as action items\n- If multiple people are assigned to one task, it's still ONE action item\n- Don't create separate tickets for related activities that should be in one ticket\n\nIMPORTANT TITLE RULES:\n- NEVER put conversation snippets in the title field\n- ALWAYS start with an action verb (Create, Fix, Update, Investigate, Review, etc.)\n- Keep titles under 60 characters\n- Focus on WHAT needs to be done, not WHO said it\n- Examples: 'Fix login timeout issue', 'Update API documentation', 'Investigate database performance'\n\nFocus on:\n- Clear action items with verbs ({actionKeywords})\n- Decisions that require follow-up\n- Issues or bugs mentioned\n- Tasks assigned to specific people\n- Deadlines or time-sensitive items\n\nDO NOT EXTRACT:\n- Discussion points that don't result in concrete actions\n- Casual mentions of possible future work\n- Ideas or suggestions without clear commitment\n- Sub-tasks that are part of a larger action item",
