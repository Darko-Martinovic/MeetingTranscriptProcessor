```

## 📊 Validation Features Details

### Cross-Validation (`ActionItemValidator`)

- Compares AI-extracted items with rule-based extraction
- Calculates confidence scores based on multiple factors
- Detects potential false positives and false negatives
- Provides detailed validation metrics

### Hallucination Detection (`HallucinationDetector`)

- Validates context snippets exist in original transcript
- Checks assignee names against meeting participants
- Detects structural anomalies and unrealistic content
- Filters items below confidence threshold

### Consistency Management (`ConsistencyManager`)

- Automatically detects meeting type (standup, sprint, architecture, etc.)
- Adapts extraction prompts for different meeting contexts
- Supports multiple languages (en, es, fr, de, pt)
- Optimizes AI parameters based on meeting type

## 🔧 Usage Examples

### Basic Operation

```powershell
dotnet run
# Place transcript files in data/Incoming/
# Files are automatically processed
```

### Disable All Validation (Fastest Processing)

```env
ENABLE_VALIDATION=false
ENABLE_HALLUCINATION_DETECTION=false
ENABLE_CONSISTENCY_MANAGEMENT=false
```

### Enable Only Hallucination Detection

```env
ENABLE_VALIDATION=false
ENABLE_HALLUCINATION_DETECTION=true
ENABLE_CONSISTENCY_MANAGEMENT=false
```
