TRANSCRIPT:
-----------

Farid: Good afternoon everyone! I hope you're not too tired after this long day of meetings.

Paul: Bonsoir Farid! Actually, it's been productive. How are you Valery? Ready for another discussion?

Valery: Hello everyone. Yes, ready. Today was indeed busy, but let's finish this important topic.

Christopher: Hello all. The rain finally stopped here in Brussels, which is nice.

Farid: Good! So, let's discuss the Confluence template for production deployments. Paul, you mentioned this needs improvement?

Paul: Oui, exactly. The current template is too basic. When we move applications to production, especially the old .NET Framework system, we need more detailed information about database scripts.

Christopher: I agree. The operations team keeps asking for more details about T-SQL scripts and database changes.

Valery: I've been reviewing the current template. It's missing crucial information about script execution order and rollback procedures.

Farid: What specific improvements do you suggest?

Paul: We need sections for T-SQL script details, execution dependencies, and database backup requirements. The template should be more comprehensive for SQL Server deployments.

Christopher: Yes, and also impact analysis. Sometimes we don't know which tables or stored procedures are affected by the changes.

Valery: I can add sections for script validation steps, testing procedures, and environment-specific configurations. This would make the process much safer.

Farid: That sounds excellent. Valery, since you understand both the technical requirements and the current process, would you be able to update this template?

Valery: Yes, absolutely. I have experience with production deployments and I know what information the database administrators need.

Paul: Perfect choice. Valery knows the SQL Server environment very well and understands the .NET Framework deployment process.

Christopher: How long do you think this will take, Valery?

Valery: If I focus on this, I can have a draft ready by end of this week. Then we can review it together and make adjustments.

Farid: That timeline works well. This new template will help us avoid deployment issues like we had last month.

Paul: Exactement! Better documentation means fewer production problems and faster rollbacks if needed.

Christopher: I'll coordinate with the operations team to get their input on what they need in the template.

Valery: That would be very helpful. I'll also check with Darko and Aidil to see if they have suggestions from their deployment experiences.

Farid: Excellent collaboration. So we'll create a task for updating the Confluence deployment template with enhanced T-SQL and database information.

Paul: Yes, and please mention that it should include rollback procedures and dependency mapping.

Christopher: I'll create the ticket with all these requirements and assign it to Valery.

Valery: Perfect. I'll start working on this tomorrow morning.

Farid: Thank you everyone. This will definitely improve our deployment process quality.

Paul: Merci for organizing this discussion, Farid.

Christopher: À bientôt everyone!

Valery: Thank you all, see you soon!
