Meeting: Team Sprint Review Meeting
Date: 2024-01-19
Duration: 45 minutes
Participants: Sarah Chen (Product Manager), Mike Johnson (Lead Developer), Emily Davis (QA Engineer), Alex Rodriguez (DevOps Engineer)

Meeting Summary:
We conducted our sprint review for the Q1 roadmap planning and discussed the upcoming feature deployments.

Discussion Points:

Sarah Chen: "We need to prioritize the user authentication system overhaul for next sprint. This is critical for the security audit requirements."

Mike Johnson: "I can lead the authentication work. We should implement OAuth 2.0 and JWT tokens. I estimate this will take about 8 story points."

Emily Davis: "Before we deploy the authentication changes, we need comprehensive end-to-end testing. I'll create test scenarios for all user flows. This needs to be completed by February 15th."

Alex Rodriguez: "The infrastructure for the new authentication service needs to be set up in our staging environment first. I can have the Docker containers and database migrations ready by next Friday."

Sarah Chen: "Perfect. Also, we discovered some performance issues in the payment processing module during last week's load testing."

Mike Johnson: "Yes, the payment API is timing out under high load. We need to investigate the database queries and possibly implement caching."

Emily Davis: "I've been tracking this issue as JIRA-456. We should add monitoring to catch these performance regressions earlier."

Alex Rodriguez: "I can set up additional monitoring dashboards for the payment service. We need alerts when response times exceed 2 seconds."
