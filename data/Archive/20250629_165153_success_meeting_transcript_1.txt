TRANSCRIPT:
-----------

Farid: Hello Christopher, good afternoon! How is your day going?

Christopher: Hello Farid! Quite busy today, lots of meetings. How about you? Is the weather nice in Belgium?

Farid: Yes, it's actually sunny today, which is rare for this time of year! Anyway, let's discuss this PLU data issue we received from GK company.

Christopher: Right, yes. I reviewed the JSON data they sent us yesterday. There seems to be some inconsistencies with our current PLU groups, non?

Farid: Exactly. The JSON structure looks correct, but when we try to match the PLU information with our existing database, we cannot find the corresponding PLU groups. I think we need a detailed analysis.

Christopher: I agree. This could be test data or maybe their data structure is different from what we expected. We need someone technical to investigate this thoroughly.

Farid: I was thinking to assign this to Darko and Nikola. Darko has the architecture knowledge and Nikola can help with the Java implementation since this is for the new system.

Christopher: Perfect choice. Darko understands both systems and Nikola is strong with Java and data processing. What do you think should be their deliverable?

Farid: They should analyze the JSON structure, compare it with our current PLU group mapping, and provide a detailed report with recommendations. Maybe they can also suggest how to handle this data integration.

Christopher: Sounds good. Is this urgent or can they take a week to properly investigate?

Farid: Let's give them a week. It's important to get it right. The GK integration is crucial for our Q3 roadmap.

Christopher: D'accord. I'll create a ticket for this. Should I assign it to both Darko and Nikola?

Farid: Yes, please. Title it something like "Analyze PLU JSON data from GK API integration" and mark it as high priority.

Christopher: Perfect. I'll add all the context we discussed and attach the JSON samples they sent us.

Farid: Excellent. Anything else we need to discuss today?

Christopher: Non, I think we covered everything. I'll have the ticket ready by end of day.

Farid: Perfect. Thank you Christopher, have a good rest of your day!

Christopher: You too Farid, à bientôt!
