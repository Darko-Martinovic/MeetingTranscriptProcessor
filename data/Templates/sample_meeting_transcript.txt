Meeting: Weekly Team Standup - Project Phoenix
Date: 2024-01-15
Participants: Alice Johnson, Bob Smith, Carol Davis, David Wilson

Meeting Transcript:

Alice: Good morning everyone. Let's start with our weekly standup for Project Phoenix. 

Bob: I finished the authentication module last week. However, I found a bug in the password reset functionality that needs to be fixed. The reset emails aren't being sent properly.

Alice: Thanks Bob. Can you investigate that bug this week and get it resolved by Friday?

Bob: Yes, I'll look into it today and should have a fix ready by Wednesday.

Carol: I've been working on the user interface design. I completed the dashboard mockups, but we need to review them with the stakeholders. I think we should schedule a review meeting with the product team by the end of this week.

Alice: Good point Carol. Can you set up that meeting and invite the product team?

Carol: Absolutely, I'll send out the invites today.

David: I'm working on the database optimization. I discovered some performance issues with the user queries when we have more than 10,000 users. We need to add proper indexing and possibly consider database sharding for scalability.

Alice: That sounds critical. What's your timeline for the optimization work?

David: I estimate it will take about 2 weeks to implement the indexing improvements and another week to test the sharding approach. I should have a preliminary report ready by next Monday.

Action Items:
- Bob: Fix password reset email bug (Due: Wednesday)
- Carol: Schedule UI review meeting with product team (Due: This week)
- David: Implement database indexing improvements (Due: 2 weeks)
- David: Prepare database performance report (Due: Next Monday)
- Alice: Follow up on deployment timeline with DevOps team

Meeting Notes:
- Project Phoenix is on track for Q1 delivery
- Need to address performance concerns before user acceptance testing
- UI review is critical for finalizing the design
- Password reset bug is blocking QA testing

Next Meeting: January 22, 2024
