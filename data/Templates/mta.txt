TRANSCRIPT:
-----------

John: Hello Mike, good afternoon! How is your day going?

Mike: Hello John! Quite busy today, lots of meetings. How about you? Is the weather nice in Belgium?

John: Yes, it's actually sunny today, which is rare for this time of year! Anyway, let's discuss this PLU data issue we received from GK company.

Mike: Right, yes. I reviewed the JSON data they sent us yesterday. There seems to be some inconsistencies with our current PLU groups, non?

John: Exactly. The JSON structure looks correct, but when we try to match the PLU information with our existing database, we cannot find the corresponding PLU groups. I think we need a detailed analysis.

Mike: I agree. This could be test data or maybe their data structure is different from what we expected. We need someone technical to investigate this thoroughly.

John: I was thinking to assign this to David and Jack. David has the architecture knowledge and Jack can help with the Java implementation since this is for the new system.

Mike: Perfect choice. David understands both systems and Jack is strong with Java and data processing. What do you think should be their deliverable?

John: They should analyze the JSON structure, compare it with our current PLU group mapping, and provide a detailed report with recommendations. Maybe they can also suggest how to handle this data integration.

Mike: Sounds good. Is this urgent or can they take a week to properly investigate?

John: Let's give them a week. It's important to get it right. The GK integration is crucial for our Q3 roadmap.

Mike: D'accord. I'll create a ticket for this. Should I assign it to both David and Jack?

John: Yes, please. Title it something like "Analyze PLU JSON data from GK API integration" and mark it as high priority.

Mike: Perfect. I'll add all the context we discussed and attach the JSON samples they sent us.

John: Excellent. Anything else we need to discuss today?

Mike: Non, I think we covered everything. I'll have the ticket ready by end of day.

John: Perfect. Thank you Mike, have a good rest of your day!

Mike: You too John, à bientôt!
