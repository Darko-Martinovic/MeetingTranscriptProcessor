TRANSCRIPT:
-----------

John: Hello everyone, thanks for joining this urgent call. Alex, how was your weekend?

Alex: Hello John, hello Mike. Weekend was good, but I spent some time thinking about this Promo Search issue. It's quite problematic.

Mike: Bonjour everyone. Yes, I've been getting reports from the business users since Friday afternoon.

John: Alex, can you explain what exactly is happening with the Promo Search stored procedure?

Alex: Bien s√ªr. The stored procedure "sp_PromoSearch" is returning incorrect results when users search for promotions by date range. Sometimes it returns no results, sometimes duplicate entries.

Mike: This is causing major issues in the stores. The cashiers cannot see active promotions and customers are complaining.

John: How urgent is this? Can we wait until next week?

Alex: Non, non! This needs to be fixed immediately. It's affecting daily operations in all Belgian stores. The SQL Server database is showing some strange behavior in the execution plan.

Mike: I agree with Alex. This is blocking business operations. We need someone who knows SQL Server and the old .NET Framework system very well.

Alex: I think Tom would be the best choice. He has good experience with stored procedures and the legacy system architecture.

John: Yes, Tom is very good with SQL Server optimization. But is he available today?

Alex: I checked with the EPAM team this morning. Tom can start on this immediately. He just needs access to the production logs and the stored procedure source code.

Mike: Perfect. What's the expected timeline for the fix?

Alex: If it's a query optimization issue, Tom can probably fix it today or tomorrow morning. If it's data corruption, it might take longer.

John: Let's prioritize this as critical. Alex, can you provide technical support to Tom if needed?

Alex: Absolument! I'll be available all week to help with the .NET Framework integration and database schema questions.

Mike: I'll monitor the business impact and communicate with the store managers.

John: Excellent. So we create a critical bug ticket for Tom to investigate and fix the Promo Search stored procedure.

Alex: Yes, and please mention that he should check the execution plan and recent database changes. I suspect it might be related to the indexing strategy.

Mike: I'll create the ticket right after this call with all the technical details Alex mentioned.

John: Perfect. Anything else we need to discuss?

Alex: Non, I think we have a clear plan. The sooner Tom starts, the better.

Mike: D'accord. I'll send the ticket details to everyone once it's created.

John: Thank you both. Let's hope we can resolve this quickly!
