Sprint Planning Meeting - E-Commerce Platform Team
Date: 2025-01-15
Time: 10:00 AM - 11:30 AM
Participants: Sarah Chen (Product Owner), Mike Rodriguez (Tech Lead), Lisa Wang (Senior Developer), John Kumar (QA Engineer), Alex Thompson (UX Designer)

Sarah: Good morning everyone. Let's dive into our Sprint 12 planning. We have some critical items to address for the Q1 release.

Mike: Before we start, I want to highlight that we have a critical login bug affecting 15% of users. This needs to be our top priority.

Sarah: Absolutely. Mike, can you take the lead on fixing that login issue? I'm marking this as critical priority.

Mike: Yes, I'll tackle that first thing. I should have a fix ready by Wednesday.

Lisa: I've been working on the API documentation, and it's severely outdated. The authentication endpoints aren't properly documented, which is causing issues for our mobile team.

Sarah: Good catch, Lisa. Can you prioritize updating the API documentation this sprint? 

Lisa: Sure, I'll focus on the authentication and user management sections first, then move to the payment APIs.

John: Speaking of testing, we need to set up automated testing for the entire login flow. Right now we're manually testing everything.

Mike: That's a great point. John, can you work with me on creating those automated tests once I fix the login bug?

John: Absolutely. I'll also need to schedule a comprehensive code review session for the authentication module.

Alex: From a UX perspective, we're getting feedback that the checkout process is confusing. Users are abandoning carts at the payment step.

Sarah: That's concerning. Alex, can you investigate the checkout user flow and prepare some recommendations?

Alex: I'll do a full UX audit of the checkout process and create wireframes for improvements.

Lisa: We should also consider implementing two-factor authentication. It's been on our backlog for months.

Mike: Good idea. That might be a good feature for Sprint 13 though, since we're already loaded this sprint.

Sarah: Let's also plan for the mobile app integration. The API changes will affect the mobile team's work.

John: I'll coordinate with the mobile QA team to ensure our API changes don't break their integration tests.

Mike: One more thing - we need to upgrade our database connections to handle the increased load we're expecting.

Sarah: How long do you think that will take, Mike?

Mike: Probably a couple of days if we do it right. I'll plan for that in the second week of the sprint.
